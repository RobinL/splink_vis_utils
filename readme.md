Very early work in progress

## Aims

Tool that process Splink settings files and visualise the outputs of Splink.

For example, visualise a trained model, or visualise a cluster.

## Dev notes

Tests using test explorer should be working, including breakpoints. If not, you can run tests with the debugger with:

```
node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js
```
